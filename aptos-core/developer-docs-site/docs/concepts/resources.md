# Resources

On Aptos, on-chain state is organized into resources and modules. These are then stored within the individual accounts. This is different from other blockchains, such as Ethereum, where each smart contract maintains their own storage space. Additionally, [event handles](./events.md) are defined within resources. See [Accounts](./accounts.md) for more details on accounts.

## Resources vs Objects

Resources refer to top-level objects that are stored directly with an account on the blockchain. Both resources and objects are instances of structs. Objects can be resources but can also be individual units of state that are stored inside a resource. An example here is how the APT coin is stored: CoinStore is the resource that contains the APT coin, while the Coin itself is an object:

```rust
/// A holder of a specific coin type and associated event handles.
/// These are kept in a single resource to ensure locality of data.
struct CoinStore<phantom CoinType> has key {
    coin: Coin<CoinType>,
}

/// Main structure representing a coin/token in an account's custody.
struct Coin<phantom CoinType> has store {
    /// Amount of coin this address has.
    value: u64,
}
```

The Coin object can be taken out of CoinStore with the owning account's permission and easily transferred to another CoinStore resource. It can also be kept in any other custom resource, if the definition allows, for example:

```rust
struct CustomCoinBox<phantom CoinType> has key {
    coin: Coin<CoinType>,
}
```

## Define resources and objects

All objects and resources are defined within a module that is stored at an address. For example `0x1234::coin::Coin<0x1234::coin::SomeCoin>` would be represented as:

```
module 0x1234::coin {
    struct CoinStore<phantom CoinType> has key {
        coin: Coin<CoinType>,
    }

    struct SomeCoin { }
}
```

In this example, `0x1234` is the address, `coin` is the module, `Coin` is a struct that can be stored as a resource, and `SomeCoin` is a struct that is unlikely to ever be represented as an object. The use of the phantom type allows for there to exist many distinct types of `CoinStore` resources with different `CoinType` parameters.

## Dual ownership of objects, including resources

Objects (including resources) on Aptos are owned by both:
1. The account where the object is stored.
2. The module that defines the object.

Creating a new resource and storing it into an account requires both the owning account's signature and the module's code. But modifying and deleting the resource/object requires only the module's code and the owning account's address, but not its signature. The fields of an object also can be read only directly by the module's code, which can be offered as public utilities for other modules.

This dual-ownership design is one of the bases of state safety in Aptos Move and enables powerful but safe functionalities to be built around resources and objects.

## Viewing a resource

Resources are stored within specific accounts. Resources can be located by searching within the owner's account for the resource at its full query path inclusive of its address and module. Resources can be viewed on the [Aptos Explorer](https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/) by searching for the owning account or be directly fetched from a fullnode's API. See [Interacting with the blockchain](../guides/interacting-with-the-blockchain.md) for more information.

## How resources are stored

It's up to the smart contract developers to decide how and where a specific state is stored. For example, events for depositing a token can be stored in the receiver account where the deposit happens or in the account where the token module is deployed. In general, storing data in individual user accounts enables a higher level of execution efficiency as there would be no state read/write conflicts among transactions, and they can be executed in parallel.
