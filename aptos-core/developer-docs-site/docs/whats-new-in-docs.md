## 08 December 2022

- Released [aptos-node-v1.1.0](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases/tag/aptos-node-v1.1.0) to Mainnet:

  Framework upgrade through governance voting:
  - Testnet upgrade - Nov 30th
  - Mainnet upgrade - Dec 12th - 19th (7 days voting period) required by fullnode operators

  New features and enhancements:
  - Move
    - [New chain_id native function + corresponding new gas schedule entry](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/pull/5288).
  - Blockchain
    - Added automatic chain-health based back pressure to improve reliability. Automatic slow-down (through max block size reduction) is triggered in some scenarios.
