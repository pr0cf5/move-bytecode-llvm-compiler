# Staking Pool Operations

This document describes how to perform staking pool operations. Note that you can stake only when you meet the minimal staking requirement. 

:::tip Minimum staking requirement
The current required minimum for staking is 1M APT tokens.
:::

## Connect to Aptos network

[Connect to the Aptos](./connect-to-aptos-network.md) and start your node has with `validator-identity` and `validator-fullnode-identity` addresses using your staking pool address.

## Initializing the stake pool

Make sure that this initializing the stake pool step was performed by the owner. See [Initialize staking pool](/nodes/validator-node/owner/index#initialize-staking-pool) in the owner documentation section.

## Joining validator set

:::danger Errors? 
**The validator node cannot sync until the stake pool becomes active.** If you see errors, see the [Issues and Workarounds](/docs/issues-and-workarounds.md).
:::

Follow the below steps to set up the validator node using the operator account and join the validator set.

:::tip Mainnet vs Testnet
The below CLI command examples use mainnet. See the `--rest-url` value for testnet or devnet in [Aptos Blockchain Deployments](/docs/nodes/aptos-deployments.md).
:::

### 1. Initialize Aptos CLI

  ```bash
  aptos init --profile mainnet-operator \
  --private-key <operator_account_private_key> \
  --rest-url https://fullnode.mainnet.aptoslabs.com/v1 \
  --skip-faucet
  ```
  
:::tip
The `account_private_key` for the operator can be found in the `private-keys.yaml` file under `~/$WORKSPACE/keys` folder.
:::

### 2. Check your validator account balance 

Make sure you have enough APT coins to pay for gas. You can check for this either on the Aptos Explorer or using the CLI:

- On the Aptos Explorer `https://explorer.aptoslabs.com/account/<account-address>?network=Mainnet`, or 
- Use the CLI:

  ```bash
  aptos account list --profile mainnet-operator
  ```
    
This will show you the coin balance you have in the validator account. You will see an output like below:
    
```json
"coin": {
    "value": "5000"
  }
```

:::tip Already in validator set? Skip to Step 6
If you know you are already in the validator set, then skip steps 3, 4, and 5 and go directly to step 6 to confirm it.
:::

### 3. Update validator network addresses on-chain

```bash
aptos node update-validator-network-addresses  \
  --pool-address <pool-address> \
  --operator-config-file ~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME/operator.yaml \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

:::tip Important notes
The network address updates and the consensus key rotation will be applied only at the end of the current epoch. Note that the validator need not leave the validator set to make these updates. You can run the commands for address and key changes. For the remaining duration of the current epoch your validator will still use the old key and addresses but when the epoch ends it will switch to the new key and addresses.
:::

### 4. Rotate the validator consensus key on-chain

```bash
aptos node update-consensus-key  \
  --pool-address <pool-address> \
  --operator-config-file ~/$WORKSPACE/$USERNAME/operator.yaml \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

### 5. Join the validator set

```bash
aptos node join-validator-set \
  --pool-address <pool-address> \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

The validator set is updated at every epoch change. You will see your validator node joining the validator set only in the next epoch. Both validator and validator fullnode will start syncing once your validator is in the validator set.

:::tip When is next epoch?
Run the command `aptos node get-stake-pool` as shown in [Checking your stake pool information](#checking-your-stake-pool-information). You can also follow these steps: [How to find out when the next epoch starts](/issues-and-workarounds#how-to-find-out-when-the-next-epoch-starts).
:::

### 6. Check the validator set
   
When you join the validator set, your validator node will be in "Pending Active" state until the next epoch occurs. **During this time you might see errors like "No connected AptosNet peers". This is normal.** Run the below command to look for your validator in the "pending_active" list.

```bash
aptos node show-validator-set --profile mainnet-operator | jq -r '.Result.pending_active' | grep <pool_address>
```

When the next epoch happens, the node will be moved into "active_validators" list.  Run the below command to see your validator in the "active_validators" list:

```bash
aptos node show-validator-set --profile mainnet-operator | jq -r '.Result.active_validators' | grep <pool_address>
```

## Checking your stake pool information

:::tip How validation works
Before you proceed, see [Validation on the Aptos blockchain](/concepts/staking#validation-on-the-aptos-blockchain) for a brief overview.
:::

To check the details of your stake pool, run the below CLI command with the `get-stake-pool` option by providing the `--owner-address` and `--url` fields. 

The below command is for an example owner address `e7be097a90c18f6bdd53efe0e74bf34393cac2f0ae941523ea196a47b6859edb`. 

:::tip
For testnet or devnet `--url` field values, see [Aptos Blockchain Deployments](/nodes/aptos-deployments).
:::

```bash
aptos node get-stake-pool \
  --owner-address e7be097a90c18f6bdd53efe0e74bf34393cac2f0ae941523ea196a47b6859edb \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

### Description of output fields

**state**
- "Active": Validator is already in the validator set and proposing.
- "Pending_active": Validator will be added to the validator set in the next epoch. **Do not try to join the validator set again before the arrival of next epoch, or else you will receive an error. **

**pool_address**
- Use this "pool_address" (not the operator address) in you `validator.yaml` file. If you mistakenly used the operator address, you will receive the message: "Validator not in validator set". 

**commission_percentage**
- This can be set only by the stake pool owner. Operator receives the "commission_percentage" of the generated staking rewards. If you request the commission (you can do so by running the command `aptos stake request-commission`), then at the end of the `lockup_expiration_utc_time` the commission part of the rewards will go to the operator address while the rest will stay in the stake pool and belong to the owner. Here "the commission part of the rewards" means the value of **commission_not_yet_unlocked**. 

  For example, in a scenario with a lock up of one month, you call `aptos stake request-commission` every month. This will pay out the commission that was accrued during the previous month but only when unlocked at the end of the previous month. Regardless of how often you run `aptos stake request-commission` during the month, the commission is only paid out upon the completion of `lockup_expiration_utc_time`.

  :::tip Compounding
  Note that if you do not request commission for multiple months, your commission will accrue more due to compounding of the **commission_percentage** during these months.
  :::


**commission_not_yet_unlocked**
- The amount of commission (amount of APT) that is not yet unlocked. It will be unlocked at the `lockup_expiration_utc_time`. This is the total commission amount available to the operator, i.e., the staking rewards **only** to the operator. This does not include the staking rewards to the owner.

**lockup_expiration_utc_time**
- The date when the commission will unlock. However, this unlocked commission will not be auto-disbursed. It will only disburse when the command `aptos stake request-commission` is called again.

**epoch_info**
- Use the [Epoch Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/) to convert the `unix_time` into human readable time. 

## Requesting commission

Either an owner or an operator can request commission. You can request commission at the end of a lockup period, i.e., at the end of **lockup_expiration_utc_time**, by running the `aptos stake request-commission` command. Make sure to provide the operator and the owner addresses. See an example command below:

```bash
aptos stake request-commission \
  --operator-address 0x3bec5a529b023449dfc86e9a6b5b51bf75cec4a62bf21c15bbbef08a75f7038f \
  --owner-address 0xe7be097a90c18f6bdd53efe0e74bf34393cac2f0ae941523ea196a47b6859edb \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

If you run the `aptos stake request-commission` command before the end of the the lockup expiration, the command will initiate unlock for any locked commission earned up until that moment in time.

See example below:

Month 1 Day 29, you call the command, it would initiate unlock for 29 days worth of commission.

Month 2, Day 29, if you call the command again, it would disburse the fully unlocked commission from previous month (29 days worth), and initiate commission unlock for Month 1 Day 30 + Month 2 Day 1-29 (30 days worth).

Month 3, Day 29, if you call the commission again, 30 days of commission would be disbursed, and the a new batch of commission would initiate unlock.

You can call the command multiple times, and the amount you receive depends on the day when you requested commission unlock previously.

## Frequently used staking operations commands

### Checking your validator performance

To see your validator performance in the current and past epochs and the rewards earned, run the below command. The output will show the validator's performance in block proposals, and in governance voting and governance proposals. Default values are used in the below command. Type `aptos node get-performance --help` to see default values used.

```bash
aptos node get-performance \ 
  --pool-address <pool address> \
  --profile mainnet-operator
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "Result": {
    "current_epoch_successful_proposals": 56,
    "current_epoch_failed_proposals": 0,
    "previous_epoch_rewards": [
      "12312716242",
      "12272043711",
      "12312912674",
      "12313011054",
      "12313109435",
      "12180092056",
      "12313305136",
      "12313403519",
      "12313501903",
      "12313600288"
    ],
    "epoch_info": {
      "epoch": 68,
      "epoch_interval": 3600000000,
      "last_epoch_start_time": {
        "unix_time": 1665074662417326,
        "utc_time": "2022-10-06T16:44:22.417326Z",
        "local_time": "Thu Oct  6 16:44:22 2022"
      },
      "next_epoch_start_time": {
        "unix_time": 1665078262417326,
        "utc_time": "2022-10-06T17:44:22.417326Z",
        "local_time": "Thu Oct  6 17:44:22 2022"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Description of fields

**current_epoch_successful_proposals**
- Successful leader-validator proposals during the current epoch. Also see [Validation on the Aptos blockchain](/concepts/staking#validation-on-the-aptos-blockchain) for the distinction between leader-validator and the voter-validator.

**previous_epoch_rewards**
- An ordered list of rewards earned (APT amounts) for the previous 10 epochs, starting with the 10 epoch in the past. In the above example, a reward of 12312716242 APT was earned 10 epochs past and a reward of 12313600288 APT was earned in the most recent epoch. If a reward is 0 for any epoch, then:
  - Either the validator was not part of the validator set in that epoch (could have been in either inactive or pending_active validator state), or
  - The validator missed all the leader proposals.

### Checking the performance for all epochs

To check the performance of all the epochs since the genesis, run the below command. You can filter the results for your pool address with `grep`, as shown below:

```bash
aptos node analyze-validator-performance \
  --analyze-mode detailed-epoch-table \
  --profile mainnet-operator \
  --start-epoch 0 | grep <pool address>
```
