# the source_addr and post_mint_reveal_nft here are for unit test purposes.
# in production, we should change them:
# - the source_addr should be the address of the account that creates the resource account
# - the post_mint_reveal_nft should be put as "_" if we publish the module by using the CLI command
# "aptos move create-resource-account-and-publish-package ..." because the CLI will automatically link
# the address to the package. If we are not using the CLI, the post_mint_reveal_nft should be the address
# of the resource account which is also the module publisher.
