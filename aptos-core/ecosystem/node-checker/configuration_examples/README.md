# Node Health Checker configuration examples

## How to use
See the official Node Health Checker documentation on [aptos.dev](https://aptos.dev/nodes/measure/node-health-checker) for a full guide on how to run your own instance of Node Health Checker. 

## Updating these configs
These instructions are for the Aptos Labs team. These configs are just copies of the configs we use for our hosted NHC. To update them, run this:
```
rm *
cp ~/a/internal-ops/infra/apps/node-checker/configs/* .
```
