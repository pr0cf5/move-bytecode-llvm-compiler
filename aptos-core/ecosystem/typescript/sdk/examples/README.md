**NOTE**: These examples are tested to work with the [latest SDK published to npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/aptos), not the SDK in the parent directory. Accordingly, these examples should be run against devnet. This is how the examples work by default.

If you'd like to learn more about how these examples work, please see the following tutorials:
